"""RRTMGP radiation as an exchangeable package (a composite scheme).

What this file is
-----------------
The RRTMGP radiation package as another modelling group would receive it.
It names RRTMGP's own CCPP schemes (by name only -- no file paths; the
metadata is supplied to the generator separately, as for an XML suite) and
arranges them into a few entry points.  Everything host-specific is left to
a host adapter (see cam_rrtmgp_adapter.py for CAM-SIMA's).

Slots and hooks
---------------
Every entry point is a Python function whose keyword parameters are of two
kinds, marked SLOT or HOOK below:

  SLOT -- a science component that has a sensible default inside the
          package (RRTMGP's own scheme) but that a host may swap for an
          alternative, e.g. a different cloud-optics parameterization or
          subcolumn-overlap generator.  Slots are keyword parameters WITH a
          default value.  Leaving them alone gives standard RRTMGP.

  HOOK  -- a point where the package needs something only the host can
          provide: host diagnostics/history output, where gas
          concentrations and solar input come from, the tropopause, the
          aerosol optics the host uses, the radiation-call counter.  Hooks
          are keyword parameters WITHOUT a default: Python refuses the call
          if the host forgets one.

Shortwave and longwave are separate entry points because they are called
at scientifically different frequencies (``iradsw``/``iradlw``); deciding
when each runs is host policy, so it lives in the adapter, not here.

How this reduces the complexity CCPP exposes
--------------------------------------------
In CCPP today a suite file is a flat list: atmospheric_physics'
suite_rrtmgp.xml spells out 40 scheme entries (38 distinct schemes) and 2
loops, and a host that wants RRTMGP must copy that list -- including
RRTMGP's internal glue (gas-optics preparation, aerosol band translation,
flux scatter, object allocation) and the CAM-specific pieces woven in
between.  Every one of those schemes, and every one of the 264 standard
names their 789 metadata arguments use, sits in one suite-wide namespace.

With this package:

- A host calls 4 entry points (``rrtmgp_prepare``, ``rrtmgp_shortwave``,
  ``rrtmgp_longwave``, ``rrtmgp_init_only``) instead of listing 40 schemes.
  The order of RRTMGP's internal steps is written once, here, by the people
  who own RRTMGP, instead of being re-typed into every host's suite file.
- What a host must understand is the package's call interface: 8 hooks to
  fill in and 7 optional slots -- not RRTMGP's internal data flow.
- Swapping a science component is one keyword argument
  (``rrtmgp_shortwave(..., overlap=my_overlap_scheme)``) rather than
  editing the right line(s) of a long flat list.
- The boundary between "RRTMGP" and "CAM" becomes explicit: everything in
  this file is exchangeable; everything CAM-specific is a hook filled in by
  the adapter.

What this version does NOT yet reduce (composite-scheme Stage 2): the
generated Fortran is identical to suite_rrtmgp.xml's, and RRTMGP's internal
standard names are still global.  Stage 2 makes the package's internal
names private, so only its interface names are visible to the host.
